A windows screensaver that draws funky star patterns that I first released in 2004.

I recently doubled the depth and added gravity and color, as well as moving the settings to the registry so they work again.

It will probably take a beefy machine to get a good framerate.

Drop into your C:\Windows folder to make it show up as a screensaver (will need administrator permissions on modern machines). You might be able to right-click and install it as well.
